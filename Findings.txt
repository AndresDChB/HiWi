When installing flow rules of resolution of 64, a "table full" error happens. 
When making a stats request right after the installation attempt it can be seen that only 2700-3000 flow rules have been installed.
This happens when installing the rules on an empty flow table. To ensure the flow table is empty, a deletion command is sent.
Afterwards, the program waits 7 seconds before sending a stats request to ensure that the number of flow rules is 0. 
After that the new rules are sent.
This implies that for a resolution of 64, there is a problem with the installation procedure as this experiment ensures that 
the installation is performed with a clear flow table.
This happens if the rules are sent one by one and in batches of different sizes up to sending the 4096 rules in one batch.
When the rules are batched, sending each batch right after the other is the best option. 
For some reason, sending one 512 rule batch, waiting 1 or 2 second(s) and sending more 512 rule batches afterwards
each after a waiting time as well, leads to even earlier "table full" errors right after the first batch.

This experiment was also performed with the resolution of 32. Installation was always successful.

During a drilldown resolution of 64 is completely unusable for this reason. Resolution of 32, even though it did not have any
issues with previously mentioned experiment showed incosisten behaviour during drilldowns. Sometimes a whole drilldown was 
possible without any trouble, some other times early drill down iterations already resulted in "table full" errors.
